Microtask 8:
Improve the visualization of the individualCards component. You need not send a PR, please update the work in your personal fork.

Updates:
- Distributed content across the card since most of the content was previously aligned on one side and the other side had a lot of wasted white space.
- Added a hover effect to the card so users know that hovering over the card highlights the row in the identities table below.
