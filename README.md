#### About me
I am Rashmi, an incoming Software Engineering graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University for Fall 2021. I am really interested in contributing to CHAOSS as I am super passionate about software development. I have around 1.5 years of experience as a software engineer at Intuit where I worked on building infrastructure on AWS and building full-stack applications using Javascript. Having worked in an infrastructure team, I have a strong technical background with GraphQL, Elasticsearch as well as Docker. I am a fast learner too - I have had to pickup different languages and tech-stacks on the go as part of my work and I am willing to put in the effort to learn anything that will help me get a job done.

Skills level:
- GraphQL - High
- Javascript - High, I have worked on React, Node and Angular in the past.
- Python - High
- ELK - I dont have a lot of experience with Logstash but I have worked a lot on Elasticsearch and Kibana
- SQL - Medium, I might have to read through some articles to write complex queries but I am willing to learn.
